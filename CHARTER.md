# RISC-V Vector C intrinsics TG Charter

The RISC-V Vector C intrinsics TG will aim to work towards the v1.0.0 of the RISC-V Vector C intrinsics.

The RISC-V Vector intrinsics are a set of C intrinsics (i.e. a C API) that are provided by compilers in order to provide a C programming environment for the RISC-V vector extensions. The resulting compiler-independent specification ensures portability of code.

The target of the v1.0.0 release includes the following item.

 * Improve the RISC-V Vector C intrinsics
 * Clarify the RISC-V Vector C intrinsics
 * Provide public resource for more enablement

Improvement to the RISC-V Vector C intrinsics is expected to achieve the following items.

 * Achieve functional completeness in the sense of leveraging the RISC-V Vector Extension through the intrinsics
 * Gather engagement from the GCC and LLVM community to ensure the resulting specification will address the needs of compiler infrastructure and ensure maintainability in upstream
 * Evaluate the existing intrinsics and co-work with the GCC and LLVM community to provide usable intrinsics
 * Engage with user communities (HPC SIG, ML SIG, Toolchains SIG, Managed Runtimes SIG, and Vector SIG) to ensure addressing the needs of consumers of the intrinsicsz

Clarification to the RISC-V Vector C intrinsics is expected to achieve the following item.

 * Provide user guidance to the intrinsics specification

The public resource for more enablement aims to achieve the following items.

 * Provide resource for users to extend the set of intrinsics
 * Provide resource to enable other languages to build RISC-V Vector intrinsics

To achieve its goals, the RISC-V Vector C intrinsics TG, will interact with the following groups: High-Performance Computing SIG, Machine Learning SIG, Toolchains & Runtime SIG, Managed Runtimes SIG, and Vector SIG.
