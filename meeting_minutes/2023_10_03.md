## Remaining pull request for the specification

There is a remaining pull request [0] under the repo for polishing the specification. After that, the specification will be sent to the TSC for review.

Hopefully we will have a ratified specification by the end of this year.

The PR should be on the verge of merging now by the time of this meeting minute.

[0] [rvv-intrinsic-doc #271](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/pull/271)

## C operator for the RVV type

The C operators are syntax sugar. During the meeting, Roger mentioned that this might help libraries to be ported to RVV.

Operators with semantic of `vlmax` will probably encourage the user to generate code like the following. The first loop can therefore be unrolled because `vlmax` is a loop invariant.

```c
void foo (size_t n) {}
  size_t vlmax = __riscv_vsetvlmax_e32m1();
  for (; n >=vlmax; n-=vlmax) {
    // A simpler syntax can be used here with the C operators
  }
  for () { // remainder loop still need intrinsics

  }
}
```

No pushback of this in the meeting.

A proposal to the spec from JianJian would also be desirable since we want a common place where other upstream compilers to be able to look into.
