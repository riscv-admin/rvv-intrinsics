## PR for the generator

The pull request for the intrinsic generator is now opened under [riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc#181](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/pull/181). This is a project released from SiFive under Apache 2.0 license.

The generator to be hosted under this respository will ensure that changes are done to the generator and produce scaled and consistent change into the generated document. It helps to show what has been changed in the intrinsics, making it easy for others to review.

The generator also allows more enablement from the community. Back in the time, SiFive was the main designer and implementer of the intrinsics. Now that we are heading towards a v1.0 release, the generator can also allow others to extend intrinsics with it, or generate prototypes needed for RVV intrinsics in other languages.

The PR open for review right now and please check it out. Hopefully we can close it soon.

## Changes from previous discussed issues ready

Several changes from previously discussed issues are ready.

### Adjust operand order for vmerge and vcompress

The pull request is opened under [eopXD/rvv-intrinsic-doc#3](https://github.com/eopXD/rvv-intrinsic-doc/pull/3). Not opening it to the riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc yet because the PR for the generator is not merged yet.

This pull request showcases the usage of the generator. With slight changes you can see the change that applies to all intrinsics of different SEW and LMUL of an RVV instruction.

This makes operand orders for mnemonics of `vvm` and `vxm` consistent.

Before:

```cpp
vint32m1_t vmerge_vvm_i32m1 (vbool32_t mask, vint32m1_t op1, vint32m1_t op2, size_t vl);vint32m1_t vcompress_vm_i32m1 (vbool32_t mask, vint32m1_t src, size_t vl);
```

After:

```cpp
vint32m1_t vmerge_vvm_i32m1 (vint32m1_t op1, vint32m1_t op2, vbool32_t selector, size_t vl);
vint32m1_t vcompress_vm_i32m1 (vint32m1_t src, vbool32_t selector, size_t vl);
```

The corresponding LLVM change can be addressed by [[WIP][Clang][RISCV] Update operand order for vmerge and vcompress](https://reviews.llvm.org/D140686). It is currently marked as WIP because the pull request is not yet opened to the official spec.

### Change default tail undisturbed intrinsics to tail agnostic

The pull request is opened under [eopXD/rvv-intrinsic-doc#4](https://github.com/eopXD/rvv-intrinsic-doc/pull/4). Not opening it to the riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc yet because the PR for the generator is not merged yet.

This is the work towards simplifying all unmasked non-policy intrinsics to TAMA (tail agnostic, mask agnostic). After aligning all intrinsics to TAMA, the next step will be to simplify the suffix of tail policies. This is based on the [simplification proposal from Nick Knight](https://gist.github.com/nick-knight/6cb0b74b351a25323dfb1821d3a269b9) that was shared in the meeting of 2022/10/31.

For intrinsics of the multiply-add and vslideup, the `vd` argument is still needed since the register still participates the compputation when tail agnostic. So no change in prototype but in semantic, which was tail undisturbed and now now tail agnostic.

Before:

```cpp
vint8m1_t vredsum_vs_i8mf8_i8m1 (vint8m1_t dst, vint8mf8_t vector, vint8m1_t scalar, size_t vl);
vint8mf8_t vslidedown_vx_i8mf8 (vint8mf8_t dst, vint8mf8_t src, size_t offset, size_t vl);
vint8mf8_t vcompress_vm_i8mf8 (vbool64_t mask, vint8mf8_t dest, vint8mf8_t src, size_t vl);
vint8mf8_t vmv_s_x_i8mf8 (vint8mf8_t dst, int8_t src, size_t vl);
```

After:

```cpp
vint8m1_t vredsum_vs_i8mf8_i8m1 (vint8mf8_t vector, vint8m1_t scalar, size_t vl);
vint8mf8_t vslidedown_vx_i8mf8 (vint8mf8_t src, size_t offset, size_t vl);
vint8mf8_t vcompress_vm_i8mf8 (vbool64_t mask, vint8mf8_t src, size_t vl);
int8mf8_t vmv_s_x_i8mf8 (int8_t src, size_t vl);
```

For scalar move instructions (`vmv_s_x`, `vfmv_s_f`), the change in prototype makes their intrinsics no longer available for an overloaded version.

The corresponding LLVM change can be addressed by the following, it is currently marked as WIP because the pull request us not yet opened to the official spec.

### Expose read-only CSR `vlenb` to user

[Issue](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/issues/180) has been raised that it is a frequently requested feature from users of the intrinsic. This pull request exposes this to them.

The pull request is in [riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc#182](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/rvv-intrinsic-doc/pull/182). The corresponding LLVM change can be addressed with [D141032 [Clang][RISCV] Expose vlenb to user](https://reviews.llvm.org/D141032).

With future extensions of the intrinsics in mind, the exposure of vxsat, vxrm, and vcsr in vread_csr and vwrite_csr will confuse user and we should remove them. Furthermore, vstart is pretty much always kept to zero, and intrinsic users probably should not have access to them. The considerations above are why the pull request proposes to add a new function rather than extending upon `vread_csr` and `vwrite_csr`, which can be removed in the future when the rounding mode and exception intrinsics are added.

## Draft for ratification plan

A textual draft will be shared in the mailing list soon.

Rafael Sene: Do you anticipate any pushbacks from the community for these changes?

eop: GCC don't support RVV intrinsics now. They are well aware of the changes here and will implement whatever is defined as v1.0 into the compiler. On the otherhand, although LLVM currently has an implemented version of intrinsics (marked as v0.10), the mapping from existing ones to the new ones won't be a trouble because we will append a common prefix to all intrinsics. A header file can simply address this problem. So I think there won't be too much of a problem in there too.
